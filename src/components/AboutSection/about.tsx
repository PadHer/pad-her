            PadHer With Love is a nonprofit initiative committed to ending
            period poverty by equipping young girls with free sanitary pads,
            menstrual health education, and compassionate support. We believe
            every girl deserves dignity, confidence, and equal opportunityâ€”no
            matter her background.
